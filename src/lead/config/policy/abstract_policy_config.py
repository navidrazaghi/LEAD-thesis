    A policy's section subclasses this, and

    it; policy-agnostic code reads these values only through that method.

    The temporal window a policy reads is declared per modality: a
    ``_length_s`` in seconds away from the anchor, and a ``_frequency`` in Hz
    to sample that span at. Both are physical, so a config keeps its meaning
    when the simulator's tick rate changes or another dataset is logged at a
    different rate; the tick counts fall out of ``carla_fps``. Past spans
    include the anchor, so a past length of 0 means the anchor alone; future
    spans exclude it, since the anchor is the present rather than a
    prediction. A frequency must divide the simulator's tick rate evenly, and
    the stride it implies must be a multiple of the modality's storage period
    in the dataset -- the expert renders the camera streams only on save
    ticks, so RGB cannot be sampled faster than ``camera_store_freq`` allows
    however fast the simulator ran.
